# Kinematic-Analysis-of-Hyper-Redundant-Robotic-Manipulator
This Repository consists code for the Kinematic Analysis of Hyper-redundant robotic manipulator. The Kinematic Analysis can be divided into two couples Forward Kinematic analysis and Inverse Kinematic Analysis. 
Using the homogenous transformation matrix the jacobi matrix is determined. Using the Jacobi we multiply the intial end effector position co-ordinate matrix to get the change in the co-ordinates. 
This change is then added with the initial co-ordinates to simulate the motion. 

This method helps in simulation of hyper-redundant robotic manipulator motion to high accracy upto one-thousandth of feet.


This repo consists the codes for the following:
1) 3D rotational Matrix Generator.
2) Homogenous Matrix Generator.
3)Jacobian Matrix Generator.
4)Inverse Kinematics for hyper-redundant robotic manipulator.


All the codes are in Python 2.7
